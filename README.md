## Project Introduction

The project is based on Vue 3 + Spring Boot + COS + WebSocket.

This platform has a wide range of application scenarios. Its core functions are divided into 4 major categories.

1. All users can publicly upload and search for image materials on the platform to quickly find the images they need. It can be used as an emoji website, design material website, wallpaper website, etc.

2. Administrators can upload, review, and manage images, as well as analyze the images within the system.

3. For individual users, they can upload images to their private space for batch management, search, editing, and analysis. It can be used as a personal cloud disk, photo album, portfolio, etc.

4. For enterprises, they can activate a team space, invite members, share images, and collaborate in real-time editing to improve team efficiency. It can be used to provide commercial services such as enterprise event albums and internal material libraries.


The project is rich in features and covers mainstream business scenarios such as file storage, content search, permission control, and real-time collaboration. It employs various programming concepts, architectural design methods, and optimization strategies to ensure the project's rapid iteration and stable operation.

Business and technology are combined in this end-to-end enterprise-level (commercial-level) project design and development, guaranteeing you a fulfilling experience!
